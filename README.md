# Crypto Tracker Widget

The Crypto Tracker widget is an Rainmeter tool designed for seamless cryptocurrency monitoring and conversion. Using data from Kraken’s API, this widget allows users to track the current value of a specified cryptocurrency against fiat currencies and perform conversions between two selected cryptocurrencies.

A swap button enables you to toggle effortlessly between tracking a single currency’s value—including the balance you hold—and converting between two cryptocurrencies, offering a smooth, integrated experience.

## Installation:

1. Download and install [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) if it is not already installed.

2. Download the latest Crypto Tracker.rmskin file.

4. Double-click the .rmskin file to launch the Rainmeter Skin Installer.

5. Follow the prompts in the installer to add the Crypto Tracker widget to Rainmeter.

6. Once installed, load the widget from Rainmeter's Manage menu.

## Usage

1. Track a single cryptocurrency: Choose a cryptocurrency and enter a balance.
   
2. Switch to conversion mode: Click the swap button to toggle to conversion mode, where you can select two cryptocurrencies and view the conversion rate between them.

3. Seamless integration: The swap button allows you to alternate between modes quickly, ensuring a smooth, uninterrupted experience.

You can change the fiat currency displayed by editing the Swapping.ini and CryptoTracker.ini files. Open each file in a text editor and locate the [Variables] section. To change the fiat currency used for conversions, modify Currency=USD to an alternative currency code, such as EUR, JPY, AUD, GBP, CAD, CNY, or CHF. For example: Currency=EUR
